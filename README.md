# Mahantariksh ki Jung

Mahantariksh ki Jung is an exciting space-themed game developed using Pygame. In this game, players control spaceships and engage in a battle to score points by shooting bullets and thunderbolts at each other. The objective is to hit the opponent's spaceship while avoiding collisions and maximizing your score.

I am excited to present this, my very first project created within a span of just two days after learning Python. This game showcases my early exploration and application of Python programming skills. It has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to gain hands-on experience with Pygame and implement basic game mechanics. Despite its simplicity, this project holds a special place as my stepping stone into the world of programming
